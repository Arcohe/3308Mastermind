Mastermind Game

Mastermind is a classic and simple strategy game. There is a "code" made of four colored dots that the player needs to guess. Some feedback is provided to the player, but they must use it to change their guess until they can guess the correct code.
Using Python, we implemented this game with three different difficulty settings.
